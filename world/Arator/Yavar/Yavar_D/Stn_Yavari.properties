displayName=Yavari Insurgency - Secret Trading Post
splash.0=This can be a good place to acquire certain items that are less than legal. Just don't insult their religion.
splash.1=The station has strange symbols painted on the hull. Large cannons track your ship as it slides into the dock. At the airlock, you're greeted by masked, heavily armed guards.
splash.2=You've heard that the Yavari want to overthrow the Siskiyu government and replace it with a theocracy. You're not sure if this is true, but they're definitely all very devout.
splash.3=Just past the canteen is a hall of shrines to the gods of the extensive Yavar pantheon. Hedvig of the Hundred Arms and Hundred Eyes seems to be the most popular here.
splash.4=A priest greets you at your ship, along with a contingent of guards. "Yaromir of the Red Mask smiles upon your arrival, traveler." Hopefully that's a good thing.
splash.5=On the one hand, it's a bit weird to be escorted around the station by masked guards. On the other hand, it's really nice to never have to ask for directions.
splash.6=On the way to the canteen, everyone around you suddenly stops and kneels. Someone pulls you down with them. "Don't you know?," they say, pointing at the procession ahead. "That's Meyransa! The Oracle!"
splash.7=On the way back to your ship, one of your escorts offers you a free copy of the holy book 'The Beginning and End of the Near and Far'. You politely decline.
splash.9=Yavaris make fearsome mercenaries, but they'll only fight for the side that the Oracles deem most correct. They believe that those who die for a righteous cause will reach Azadudiyar.
splash.10=The food here isn't bad, but it's very bland. The Yavari believe it encourages moderate eating.
