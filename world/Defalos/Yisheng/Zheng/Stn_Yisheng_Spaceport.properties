splash.0=Yisheng is known for its advanced biological research. \nYou never know what kind of strange creature you'll run into here.
splash.1=You've heard that a lot of unethical human experimentation happens on Yisheng. \nYou try not to think about this this as you enjoy your bio-engineered dinner.
splash.2=Today you've ordered a local delicacy called four-dimensional beef. \nIt grows larger as it sits on your plate. \nYou eat it quickly before it flits back out of existence.
splash.3=Sitting at the bar, a strange creature takes the seat next to you. \nYou suppose it was once a man, but what could it possibly do with that many mouths?
splash.4=*ding* Attention, all personnel! If you encounter a small rodent with dull purple fur, \nplease notify a security officer immediately. For your own safety, do not approach.
