splash.0=*ding* 9/10 star captains recommend Aporia Hydrogen - the smoothest, purest fuel in the verse!
splash.1=Aporia is a wandering gas giant far from any star. \nThe darkness here is absolute.
splash.2=You've never seen a bar so well-stocked. \nThe bartender seems to notice your shock. 'You see anything else to do here?' she asks.
splash.3=As far as you're concerned, hydrogen is hydrogen, but racers all swear by Aporia.
splash.4=It's open mic night at the bar today. \nYou had no idea there were so many ways to tell the same joke about hydrogen peroxide.
splash.5='They told me a stint on Aporia would be just the thing. \nI could get away from all of life's distractions and finally finish my novel. \nAh, well, they were half right.'
splash.7='Heh. When I moved here I said I could never get tired of that night sky. \nBut what I wouldn't give to get some real sun again!'
splash.8=Aporia Hydrogen Harvesting is owned by the Mavarellis, a wealthy family from Valadro. \nAs far as you know, they've never set foot here.
splash.9=Aporia was discovered relatively recently, and not all of its moons have been completely surveyed. \nThey say some of them might be warm enough to have life below the surface.
